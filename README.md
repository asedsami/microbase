# Microbase

I'm creating this node.js service to be the base or the core service in the microservices artitecture. It's going to handle both the authentication and the autherization of the services. what I have in mind is that you run it, and use it. nice and simple. the API should be consist of the login and signup of users. registering services. 
treating services(apps) like users in which they should have roles and permissions.
